      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The $DD token represents transparency, consistency, and evolution in the decentralized ecosystem. 
        Built on Solana, $DD began as a fair launch initiative designed to build a strong, long-term community 
        around innovation, education, and self-development.

    <section class="card" id="problem">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Many decentralized projects prioritize hype over substance. This results in unsustainable growth and 
        community fragmentation. The $DD mission is to create a token that not only represents its holders but 
        also funds projects with real impact — merging blockchain with knowledge, creativity, and innovation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        $DD focuses on authentic progress — a transparent roadmap, consistent communication, and long-term goals. 
        The token’s purpose extends beyond speculation: it’s a foundation for the development of future projects, 
        including the 2026 initiative "Project ‘26", where $DD holders play a direct role in direction and rewards.
